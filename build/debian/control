Description: Dynamic array library for C
 Jarray is a C library that provides
 a dynamic array implementation with support cloning, sorting, filtering...
 This package contains the static and shared libraries, along
 with the development header files required to build software
 against jarray. Note that I'm a beginner programmer, so don't take this code too seriously. This is a learning project!
